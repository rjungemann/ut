# Ultimate Tally (ut)

Created by thefifthcircuit

## Is this project competing with...?

Ultimate Tally is a successor to tally (by obskein) and tally-ac by me.

It is not a competitor with Rallycat or the Chrome extension created by Chase.
In fact it works well in concert either of the above!

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/thefifthcircuit/ut.git
    cd ut
    rake install

Be sure to set the `RALLY_USERNAME`, `RALLY_PASSWORD`, and `RALLY_PROJECT`
environment variables.

## Usage

    ut help
    ut list '<iteration_name>'
    ut update '<story_number>'
    RALLY_PROJECT='ACME' ut list '<iteration_name>'
    ut add requirements US1234
    ut add all US1234
    ut add bug_tasks US1234
    ut add boilerplate US1234
    ut delete US1234 '<task_name>'
    ut delete_all '<task_name>'

    # Bonus method
    ut generate_rallycatrc # generate a ~/.rallycatrc from ut settings!
